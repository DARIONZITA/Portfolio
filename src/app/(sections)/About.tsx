            <p >My name is DÃ¡rio Nzita and I'm a full stack 
                developer with <span className="text-contrast-500"> over a year of experience</span>.
                At the moment I work as a freelancer having worked mainly 
                with <span className="text-contrast-500">MERN Stack</span> and <span className="text-contrast-500" >Next.js</span> technologies.</p>
            <p >My journey into the
                     world of code began when I realized the incredible
                      potential it holds to shape the way we interact with technology.
                       Whether it's translating creative designs into pixel-perfect websites 
                       or architecting databases that handle data with grace, 
                       I'm in my element when solving complex puzzles with elegant solutions.
            </p>
